# Coffeeshop Geeking

Here's a quick one-off analysis/visualization of coffee shop locations in NCR. 

The locations were pulled from the Foursquare API, but I think I'm not getting them all. I might have to improve the Foursquare scraping code block. If that fails, I might have to go to Google Locations for better data on cafes/coffee shops.

This was built using Python 3 on a Jupyter notebook using Folium, Pandas, and  Python's json libraries.
